    long_description="""
    This library is designed to be a small, flexible and convenient wrapper for a variety of crypto algorithms. So it can be used in a small microcontroller as well as in a high load server application. Also, it provides several custom hybrid algorithms that combine different crypto algorithms to solve common complex cryptographic problems in an easy way. This eliminates the requirement for developers to have strong cryptographic skills.

    The library is available for different platforms and contains wrappers for other languages.
