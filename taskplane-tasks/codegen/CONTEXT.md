# Codegen — Context

**Last Updated:** 2026-04-04
**Status:** Active
**Next Task ID:** TBD

---

## Ownership

This task area owns the replacement of the legacy iMatix/GSL-based generator with a new maintainable generator.

Current project scope for Taskplane work:

- C generation only
- `library/common` only
- preserve handwritten/manual code outside generated sections
- keep original source models under `codegen/models/**` as the long-term source of truth

---

## Current State

The `common` generator remains mixed mode at the whole-bootstrap level, but the current Taskplane `common` entity slice is now effectively closed.

Direct-from-source or direct source-driven coverage currently includes:

- `vsc_library`
- `vsc_assert`
- `vsc_memory`
- `vsc_atomic`
- `vsc_data`
- `vsc_buffer_defs`
- `vsc_buffer`

There is no longer a core `common` entity in this slice that still requires legacy resolved-XML fallback at runtime.

Related support headers:

- `vsc_common_public.h`
- `vsc_common_private.h`

remain checked-in umbrella headers with empty generated blocks and are now tracked as static support artifacts rather than as active fallback migration work.

The compile gate for this area is:

```bash
bash tools/codegen/build_common_with_new_codegen.sh
```

This script is allowed to apply generated output temporarily into the repo, build `common`, and restore generated C/header files afterward.

## Conventions

- Preserve handwritten code outside generated blocks.
- Do not commit generated changes under `library/common/**`.
- Update migration docs when direct coverage changes.
- Prefer direct lowering from original models over extending resolved-XML dependency.
- Use resolved XML only for parity reference, reverse engineering, or fixtures during migration.

---

## Planned Task Sequence

- `CG-001` — buffer family migration spec and dependency map ✅
- `CG-002` — direct lowering for `vsc_buffer_defs` ✅
- `CG-003` — support-file fallback audit and remaining-common plan ✅
- `CG-004` — direct lowering for `vsc_buffer` ✅
- `CG-005` — final common status/docs sweep after buffer migration ✅

No additional `common` core-entity implementation task is currently queued; the next task should either target parity/tooling follow-up or move to the next migration area.

---

## Technical Debt / Future Work

- Reduce remaining dependence on resolved XML outside the completed `common` core-entity slice.
- Add parity/tooling checks that make mixed-mode formatting differences easier to review.
- Revisit umbrella-header generation only if a broader project-composition emitter is introduced for reasons beyond the completed `common` migration slice.
