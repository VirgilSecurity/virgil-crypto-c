<xnf name = "module" script = "xnf_gen.gsl" version = "1.0a1">
    Module groups high level logical components within one physical
    component.

    <produce filename = "module.md" type = "gurudoc" />

    <entity name = "module">
        Module groups high level logical components within one physical
        component. Physical component is a source file, plus header file for
        C/C++. Logical component is representation of a constant, type,
        enumeration, method, etc.

        Module represents C components in a language agnostic way. This makes
        possible to generate wrappers for high level languages like C#, Java,
        Python, etc.
